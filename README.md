Blank Rails app
===

This app contains just the minimum configuration needed to start coding right
away on the things that matter. And it's easier to maintain than a rails
template.

I use this app with [this script](https://gist.github.com/3166714) to create new
Rails applications.

This is an adapted version of the [Blank Slate
app](https://github.com/foca/blank_slate_rails_app). Thanks to
[foca](https://github.com/foca) for this great idea!
